The error message you're encountering:

```plaintext
ERROR
Failed to fetch
TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

This type of error typically indicates that there is an issue with making a **network request**. It occurs when the application tries to fetch data from an endpoint, server, or API but cannot complete the request successfully. Let's break down the possible reasons for this error:

### Common Causes for "Failed to Fetch" Error:

1. **CORS Policy Issue**:
   - If you're making a request to a server that is on a different origin (domain) from the current page, the server must permit cross-origin requests by setting the appropriate headers.
   - If the target server does not include **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers, the browser will block the request.
   - Solution: The server you are trying to reach needs to add the required CORS headers. Typically:
     ```
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     ```
   - If you own the server, configure CORS properly; if not, use a **proxy server** to route requests.

2. **Network Issues**:
   - There could be an issue with the network connection or a misconfigured URL. This can happen if:
     - The URL you're trying to access is incorrect or has a typo.
     - There are network problems preventing access to the resource.
   - Solution: Double-check the URL being accessed and ensure it's correct and accessible.

3. **Server Unreachable**:
   - The server you're trying to communicate with might be down, or the endpoint URL is incorrect.
   - Solution: Test the endpoint in a browser or use a tool like **Postman** to confirm if it’s reachable.

4. **Missing Credentials or Incorrect Request Headers**:
   - Some requests may require additional headers such as an **Authorization** token or other custom headers.
   - Solution: Make sure that your request includes the necessary headers, like authentication tokens if the server requires them.

5. **File Handling Issue**:
   - Since the error seems to have occurred during a file upload (`handleFileUpload`), it could mean that the file was not read correctly or there’s an issue with the file size limit.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure that the file being uploaded is properly read by the application.
     - Check if there’s a file size limit on either the client or server-side that is causing the request to fail.

6. **Invalid Request Method**:
   - You may be using an incorrect request method (like `GET` instead of `POST`).
   - Solution: Verify that you’re using the correct request method for the server endpoint.

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Console Log the Error**:
   - Look for more specific error messages in the **Network** tab of your browser’s Developer Tools.
   - Check if there are **CORS** issues or more detailed response information that could indicate the exact problem.

2. **Inspect Network Requests**:
   - Open the **Network** tab in the browser’s DevTools to see the request that is failing.
   - Look for details on the status code, response headers, and any error messages returned by the server.

3. **Test the Endpoint Manually**:
   - Use a tool like **Postman** or **cURL** to manually test the endpoint.
   - Confirm if the endpoint is accessible, and if so, whether it requires additional headers or parameters that might be missing in your app.

4. **Handle the Error Gracefully**:
   - Update your JavaScript code to handle the `fetch` error properly so that it provides meaningful feedback to users when the fetch fails:
   ```javascript
   async function handleFileUpload(file) {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('/your-upload-endpoint', {
         method: 'POST',
         body: file,
       });
       if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
       }
       const data = await response.json();
       console.log('Upload successful', data);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Failed to upload file:', error);
       alert('There was an error uploading your file. Please try again.');
     }
   }
   ```

5. **CORS Proxy (for Testing Only)**:
   - If CORS is causing the issue and you can’t modify server settings, use a **CORS proxy** for testing purposes:
     ```
     const proxyUrl = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/';
     const targetUrl = 'https://your-api-url.com';
     const response = await fetch(proxyUrl + targetUrl);
     ```

### Example Fix Scenario:

If the error is because of a CORS policy issue, you can add CORS headers to the server-side if you have control over it. For **Node.js** with **Express**, you could use the following:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

If you don't control the server, using a **proxy server** might be a feasible temporary solution.

### Conclusion:

The `"Failed to fetch"` error points to an issue with making a network request, and in this context, it is likely due to CORS policy, incorrect URL, missing headers, or server-side problems. Investigate the `Network` tab for more clues and adjust your code or server configuration accordingly to ensure requests are correctly handled.
