"Hey Replit Agent,

We need to stop the current approach of setting up the front-end and backend. I already have the entire front-end built and running on V0 by Vercel. What I need from you now is to make sure that the Flask backend you built for me is set up properly and prepared to be connected to the existing front-end.

Here are the tasks that I need you to complete:

Test and Validate the Flask Backend:

First, stop all ongoing processes related to the current configuration.
Make sure the Flask backend is running fine, and all the endpoints are functional.
Add CORS support to the backend using flask_cors to make sure it can handle requests from the front-end, which will be hosted on a different domain (Vercel).
Prepare for Deployment:

Generate the necessary requirements.txt file for all dependencies.
Create a Procfile that will be used if deploying to Heroku.
Test the Flask backend locally to make sure everything runs well.
Deploy the Backend:

Deploy the Flask backend to Heroku.
Make sure all necessary environment variables are properly set up (e.g., secret keys, configuration settings).
Provide the backend URL once deployed.
Integrate with Vercel Front-end:

The front-end is already deployed on V0 by Vercel.
Make sure the deployed backend's URL is shared, so I can update the front-end API endpoints accordingly.
Ensure the CORS settings are properly configured so the Vercel-hosted front-end can access the Heroku backend without issues.
Test Integration:

Once everything is set up, guide me on how to test the integration between the front-end and backend to verify that they work together properly.
Please prioritize these tasks, ensure all configurations are correct, and help me get the Flask backend successfully deployed and integrated with the Vercel front-end. Keep the deployment costs at zero or minimal for now, and let me know if any step requires specific actions from my side."

Preparation Notes for Replit Agent:

Ensure that the backend endpoints are RESTful and properly documented.
Double-check that flask_cors is installed and configured correctly for Vercel's domain.
Deploy the Flask backend in a way that is compatible with the Vercel front-end and doesn't require a complete reconfiguration.
Make sure to test the entire setup locally or in a staging environment before finalizing the deployment.
